  description: 'Oh dear! Cirbungulus has not died yet! He beckons for blood, for revenge,
    for his dignity that was striken away from him on that fateful day. And yet, he
    is still the villain, while you are the hero of this story. The heineous stench
    that eminates from Cirbungulus, is that of oil. His greasy hair, is the perfect
    catalyst for pushing a good man to go to war. Even his face pisses off the calmest
    man, for there is no tomfoolery in the world of Cirbungulus.


    So what are you waiting for? Punch that bitch in the nose to end it once and for
    all.


    I''d suggest reading the manual.'
